# 1. What this project is

For a non-technical person: A service that takes long payment URLs 
and turns them into short links that expire, track clicks, and block 
suspicious traffic — the same infrastructure payment providers like 
Razorpay use internally.

For an engineer: A Node.js/Express REST API backed by PostgreSQL and 
Redis that generates Base62 short codes, serves redirects from a 
read-through Redis cache, writes click analytics asynchronously off 
the request path, and enforces per-IP sliding-window rate limiting.

# 2. Problem it solves

Payment links in fintech are long, expiry-sensitive, and need fraud 
controls. A dedicated link management service gives you short shareable 
links with configurable expiry, click tracking, and rate limiting — 
without exposing raw payment gateway URLs.

# 3. Architecture

[ASCII diagram - fill after Phase 3 when full request flow is built]

Components:
- Express → handles HTTP routing and middleware
- PostgreSQL → persistent storage for links and analytics
- Redis → read-through cache for redirect path 
- k6 → load testing tool to measure p50/p95/p99
